"""Latency ceiling for the Cursor blocking path — PRD v3 §5.6 row 7 (O7). P1.

beforeShellExecution sits in the agent's inner loop: every shell command waits
on it. A gate that is merely correct but slow gets uninstalled, so the budget
is a contract, not an aspiration.

MEASURED at M0 on the reference machine (Python 3.10, warm page cache), whole
process including interpreter startup:

    clean command (no finding)   median 18.3 ms   p95 26.9 ms
    IOC path (loads the feed)    median 24.8 ms   p95 32.0 ms
    in-process decision only     median  0.003 ms

Almost all of the wall time is `python` starting up, which is why the shipped
"<10ms" figure refers to the detection itself and is met with three orders of
magnitude to spare.

Ceilings below are set well above the reference numbers on purpose. This is a
regression alarm, not a benchmark: shared CI runners are routinely 3-5x slower
and vary run to run, and a test that fails on a noisy neighbour teaches people
to rerun until green. What it must catch is a change that puts real work on
this path — a subprocess spawn, a scanner import, a network call — which would
blow past these numbers by an order of magnitude, not a few milliseconds.

Methodology follows the eval review's flakiness note: discard warmup runs, take
N samples, assert on the MEDIAN (a single p95 sample on shared CI is a coin
flip), and carry a relative check that is immune to how slow the host is.
